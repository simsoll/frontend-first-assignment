# Project description
A quick and easy purchasing website for Construction workers. The site will be used in the office and in the field, by workers and managers. 

The site must be responsive and must include: 
* A FrontPage
* A product catalogue with 2 pages including at least 16 products on each page arranged as you see fit.
* A purchase history which allows for each retrieval of information of earlier purchases and popular products.
* Scanning function (mobile version) of barcodes or products serial numbers which allows for quick order and delivery. The site is made with a one-time-set-up function (like Apple or Steam) which means the users dos not have to fill out account information on every purchase. 

# Style guide
Purpose?
* Informative
* Easy accessible: Should work on mobile 
* Not necessary to draw the user in
 * “hit and run”: Find what you are looking for, easy order and then get out of the way to continue on the “more important” work
* Relate to the user: Geometric fonts (less is more, clear, geometric to support the constructional aspect)


Audience?
* Age: 18-60
 * It’s a rather wide-aged ordinance which should be reflected in the choice of style (not too modern and too old fashioned)
* Gender: Primarily male
* Cultural niche: Working class, they know what they want. Field workers on mobile with cold and dirty fingers and office workers. 
 * We also here have a rather wide cultural spectrum. The field workers shouldn’t think “wow, this is clearly made for the managers back home” and the also the other way around.


Tone?
* Casual
* Friendly
* Formal 
* Fun

Should include
* Spacing
* Colors: Choose first a base color and thereafter a color scheme. 
 * Use saturation and value to guide the viewer and/or draw attention to something ([Price])
 * Schemes

    * http://paletton.com/#uid=23s0u0kAjDM00++i4K4HojQ+S0i
 * Black/white on the entire page and then color the important parts to draw the user toward
 * Book: I send you this cadmium red
 * http://miraclesalad.com/whatthecolor.php
 * Not use black on white (boooring)
 * Alternative to Photoshop: PIXLR.com
 * Colorcombos.com
 * Colorzilla
* Base color proposals ([Dukin])
 * Blue (security, truth, stability, loyalty, open communication)
 * White (simplicity, cleanliness, faith)
 * Brown (durability, class, age, stability)
 * Black (power, drama, bold, strong)

# Ideas
* Create the styleguide as a separate application as for Connect
 * https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/websites/sandstone/typefaces/
 * Include mark-up, styling and description/explanation sections
* Navigation ([Krug])
 * Search box, as some people will only use search boxes for navigation (or if they are in a hurry)
    * Don’t make it hard for the user – stick to the formula
 * Users should always have a sense of where they are
    * Logo in top left should get people back to the home page (gives a fresh start)
    * Highlight navigation bars indicating the current location (“You are here”). Can be used in combination with tabs both from primary (top) navigation and secondary (left) navigation thereby improving the visual cues.
 * Don’t invent the wheel – people expect navigation to be in standard places
 * Lower-level navigation should get the same attention when designing as the top-level
 * Every page needs a name. Page names are the street signs of the Web.
 * Whatever page the users is on, he/she should always be able to answer (the gangster/trunk test)
    * What site is this? (Site ID)
    * What page am I on? (Page name)
    * What are the major sections of this site? (Sections)
    * What are my options at this level?  (Local navigation)
    * Where am I in the scheme of things? (“You are here” indicators)
    * How can I search?
* Book: Designing Web Navigation
* Inspiration: www.awwwards.com
* Use tabs instead of a navigation bar
 * Why? Found out where in [Krug] this is mentioned!
